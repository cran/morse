\title{Survival dataset for \emph{Gammarus pulex} exposed to propiconazole
during 10 days with time-variable
exposure concentration (non-standard pulsed toxicity experiments)}
\format{A data frame with 74 observations on the following four variables:
\describe{ \item{\code{replicate}}{A vector of class \code{factor} with the
replicate code (\code{varControl}, \code{varA}, \code{varB} and \code{varC}).}
\item{\code{conc}}{A vector of class \code{numeric} with propiconazole
concentrations in \eqn{\mu mol.L^{-1}}.}
\item{\code{time}}{A vector of class \code{integer} with the time points
(in days from the beginning of the experiment \eqn{t = 0}).}
\item{\code{Nsurv}}{A vector of class \code{integer} with the number of
alive individuals at each time point for each concentration and each
replicate.}}}

\description{
Survival dataset of laboratory toxicity tests with \emph{Gammarus pulex}
freshwater invertebrates exposed to several profiles of concentrations
(time-variable concentration for each time series)
of one fungicide (propiconazole) during 10 days.
