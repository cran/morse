\description{
This is the generic \code{plot} S3 method for the \code{survFitTT} class. It
plots concentration-response fit under target time survival analysis.
}
\details{
The fitted curve represents the \strong{estimated survival rate} at
the target time as a function of the concentration of chemical compound;
When \code{adddata = TRUE} the black dots depict the \strong{observed survival
rate} at each tested concentration. Note that since our model does not take
inter-replicate variability into consideration, replicates are systematically
pooled in this plot.
The function plots both 95\% credible intervals for the estimated survival
rate (by default the grey area around the fitted curve) and 95\% binomial confidence
intervals for the observed survival rate (as black segments if
\code{adddata = TRUE}).
Both types of intervals are taken at the same level. Typically
a good fit is expected to display a large overlap between the two intervals.
If spaghetti = TRUE, the credible intervals are represented by two dotted
lines limiting the credible band, and a spaghetti plot is added to this band.
This spaghetti plot consists of the representation of simulated curves using parameter values
sampled in the posterior distribution (10\% of the MCMC chains are randomly
taken for this sample).
}
\note{
When \code{style = "ggplot"}, the function calls function
\code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}} and returns an object of class \code{ggplot}.

\examples{

# (1) Load the data
data(cadmium1)

# (2) Create an object of class "survData"
dat <- survData(cadmium1)

\dontrun{
# (3) Run the survFitTT function with the log-logistic
#     binomial model
out <- survFitTT(dat, lcx = c(5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 80),
                 quiet = TRUE)

# (4) Plot the fitted curve
plot(out, log.scale = TRUE, adddata = TRUE)

# (5) Plot the fitted curve with ggplot style
plot(out, xlab = expression("Concentration in" ~ mu~g.L^{-1}),
     fitcol = "blue", adddata = TRUE, cicol = "blue",
     style = "ggplot")
