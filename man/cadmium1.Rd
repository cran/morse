\title{Reproduction and survival datasets for \emph{Daphnia magna} exposed to
cadmium during 21 days}
\format{A data frame with 200 observations of the following five variables:
\describe{
\item{\code{replicate}}{A vector of class \code{numeric} with
the replicate code (\code{1} to \code{20}).}
\item{\code{conc}}{A vector of
class \code{numeric} with the cadmium concentrations in \eqn{\mu g.L^{-1}}.}
\item{\code{time}}{A vector of class \code{integer} with the time points
(in days from the beginning of the experiment \eqn{t = 0}).}
\item{\code{Nsurv}}{A vector of class \code{integer} with the number of
alive individuals at each time point for each concentration and each
replicate.} \item{\code{Nrepro}}{A vector of class \code{integer} with the
number of offspring at each time point for each concentration and each
replicate.} }}

\description{
Reproduction and survival datasets of chronic laboratory toxicity tests with
\emph{Daphnia magna} freshwater invertebrate exposed to five concentrations
of cadmium during 21 days. Five concentrations were
tested, with four replicates per concentration. Each replicate contained 10
organisms. Reproduction and survival were monitored at 10 time points.
