\arguments{
\item{data}{an object of class \code{reproData}}

\item{stoc.part}{stochastic part of the model. Possible values are \code{"bestfit"},
\code{"poisson"} and \code{"gammapoisson"}}

\eqn{EC_{x}}{ECx}}

\value{
The function returns an object of class \code{reproFitTT} which is a list
of the following objects:
\item{DIC}{DIC value of the selected model}
\item{estim.ECx}{a table of the estimated 5, 10, 20 and 50 \% effective
concentrations (by default) and their 95 \% credible intervals}

credible intervals}

for the MCMC computation}

the end of monitored iterations}

\description{
This function estimates the parameters of a concentration-effect model for
target-time reproduction analysis using Bayesian inference.
In this model the endpoint is the cumulated number of reproduction outputs over
time, with potential mortality all along the experiment.
}
\details{
Because some individuals may die during the observation period, the
reproduction rate alone is not sufficient to account for the observed number
of offspring at a given time point. In addition, we need the time individuals have stayed alive
during this observation period. The \code{reproFitTT} function estimates the number
of individual-days in an experiment between its start and the target time.
This covariable is then used to estimate a relation between the chemical compound
concentration and the reproduction rate \emph{per individual-day}.

The \code{reproFitTT} function fits two models, one where inter-individual
variability is neglected ("Poisson" model) and one where it is taken into
account ("gamma-Poisson" model). When setting \code{stoc.part} to
\code{"bestfit"}, a model comparison procedure is used to choose between
both. More details are presented in the vignette accompanying the package.
