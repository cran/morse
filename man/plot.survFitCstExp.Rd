\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{survFit}.}

\item{xlab}{A label for the \eqn{X}-axis, by default \code{Time}.}

\item{ylab}{A label for the \eqn{Y}-axis, by default \code{Survival probability}.}

\item{main}{A main title for the plot.}

\item{concentration}{A numeric value corresponding to some specific concentrations in
\code{data}. If \code{concentration = NULL}, draws a plot for each concentration.}

\item{spaghetti}{if \code{TRUE}, draws a set of survival curves using
parameters drawn from the posterior distribution}

\item{one.plot}{if \code{TRUE}, draws all the estimated curves in
one plot instead of one plot per concentration.}

with (frequentist binomial) confidence intervals}

\item{addlegend}{if \code{TRUE}, adds a default legend to the plot.}

\description{
This is the generic \code{plot} S3 method for the
\code{survFit}.  It plots the fit obtained for each
concentration of chemical compound in the original dataset.
}
\details{
The fitted curves represent the \strong{estimated survival probability} as a function
of time for each concentration.
The black dots depict the \strong{observed survival
probability} at each time point. Note that since our model does not take
inter-replicate variability into consideration, replicates are systematically
pooled in this plot.
The function plots both 95\% credible intervals for the estimated survival
probability (by default the grey area around the fitted curve) and 95\%  binomial confidence
intervals for the observed survival probability (as black error bars if
\code{adddata = TRUE}).
Both types of intervals are taken at the same level. Typically
a good fit is expected to display a large overlap between the two types of intervals.
If \code{spaghetti = TRUE}, the credible intervals are represented by two
dotted lines limiting the credible band, and a spaghetti plot is added to this band.
This spaghetti plot consists of the representation of simulated curves using parameter values
sampled in the posterior distribution (2\% of the MCMC chains are randomly
taken for this sample).
