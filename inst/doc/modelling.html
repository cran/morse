<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Models in ‘morse’ package</h1>



<p>This document describes the statistical models used in
<strong>morse</strong> to analyze survival and reproduction data, and as
such serves as a mathematical specification of the package. For a more
practical introduction, please consult the <strong>Tutorial</strong>
vignette ; for information on the structure and contents of the library,
please consult the reference manual.</p>
<p>Model parameters are estimated using Bayesian inference, where
posterior distributions are computed from the likelihood of observed
data combined with prior distributions on the parameters. These priors
are specified after each model description.</p>
<div id="survival-toxicity-tests" class="section level1">
<h1>Survival toxicity tests</h1>
<p>In a survival toxicity test, subjects are exposed to a measured
concentration of a contaminant over a given period of time and the
number of surviving organisms is measured at certain time points during
exposure. In most standard toxicity tests, the concentration is held
constant throughout the whole experiment, which we will assume for
<strong>Analysis of target time survival toxicity tests</strong>, but
not for <strong>Toxicokinetic-Toxicodynamic modeling</strong> which can
handled time variable exposure. In the case of constant exposure, an
experiment is generally replicated several times and also repeated for
various levels of the contaminant. For time-variable exposure, a profile
of exposure is usually unique, and the experiment is repeated with
several profiles of exposures.</p>
<p>In so-called <em>target time</em> toxicity tests, the mortality is
usually analyzed at the end of the experiment. The chosen time point for
this analysis is called <em>target time</em>. Let us see how this
particular case is handled in ‘morse’.</p>
<div id="analysis-of-target-time-survival-toxicity-tests" class="section level2">
<h2>Analysis of target time survival toxicity tests</h2>
<p>A dataset from a target time survival toxicity test is a collection
<span class="math inline">\(D = \{ (c_i, n_i^{init}, n_i) \}_i\)</span>
of experiments, where <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> is the
tested concentration, <span class="math inline">\(n_i^{init}\)</span>
the initial number of organisms and <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> the number of organisms at the chosen
target time. Triplets such that <span class="math inline">\(c_i =
0\)</span> correspond to control experiments.</p>
<div id="modelling" class="section level3">
<h3>Modelling</h3>
<p>In the particular case of target time analysis, the model used in
‘morse’ is defined as follows. Let <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be the target time in days. We suppose
the <em>mean survival rate after</em> <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> days is given by a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> of the contaminant level <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. We also suppose that the death of two
organisms are two independent events. Hence, given an initial number
<span class="math inline">\(n^{init}_i\)</span> of organisms in the
toxicity test at concentration <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span>,
we obtain that the number <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span> of
surviving organisms at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>
follows a binomial distribution: <span class="math display">\[
N_i \sim \mathcal{B}(n^{init}_i, f(c_i))
\]</span> Note that this model neglects inter-replicate variations, as a
given concentration of contaminant implies a fixed value of the survival
rate. There may be various possibilities for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. In ‘morse’ we assume a three
parameters log-logistic function: <span class="math display">\[
f(c) = \frac{d}{1 + (\frac{c}{e})^b}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> are (positive) parameters. In
particular <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> corresponds to the
survival rate in absence of contaminant and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> corresponds to the <span class="math inline">\(LC_{50}\)</span>. Parameter <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is related to the effect intensity of
the contaminant.</p>
</div>
<div id="inference" class="section level3">
<h3>Inference</h3>
<p>Posterior distributions for parameters <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> are estimated using the JAGS
software <span class="citation">[@rjags2016]</span> with the following
priors:</p>
<ul>
<li>we assume the range of tested concentrations in an experiment is
chosen to contain the <span class="math inline">\(LC_{50}\)</span> with
high probability. More formally, we choose: <span class="math display">\[\log_{10} e \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\frac{\log_{10}
(\min_i c_i) +
\log_{10} (\max_i c_i)}{2}, \frac{\log_{10} (\max_i c_i) -
\log_{10} (\min_i c_i)}{4} \right)\]</span> which implies <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> has a probability slightly higher than
0.95 to lie between the minimum and the maximum tested
concentrations.</li>
<li>we choose a quasi non-informative prior distribution for the shape
parameter <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\log_{10} b \sim \mathcal{U}(-2,2)\]</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The prior on <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is chosen as
follows: if we observe no mortality in control experiments then we set
<span class="math inline">\(d = 1\)</span>, otherwise we assume a
uniform prior for <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> between 0 and
1.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic-modeling" class="section level2">
<h2>Toxicokinetic-Toxicodynamic modeling</h2>
<p>For datasets featuring time series measurements, more complete models
can be used to estimate the effect of a contaminant on survival. We
assume the toxicity test consists in exposing an initial number <span class="math inline">\(n_i^0\)</span> of organisms to a concentration
<span class="math inline">\(c_i(t)\)</span> of contaminant (constant or
time-variable), and following the number <span class="math inline">\(n_i^k\)</span> of survivors at time <span class="math inline">\(t_k\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(t_0
&lt; t_1 &lt; \dots &lt; t_m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_0 = 0\)</span>), thus providing a collection
<span class="math inline">\(D = {(c_i, t_k, n_i^k)}_{i,k}\)</span> of
experiments. In ‘morse’, we propose two Toxicokinetic-Toxicodynamic
(TKTD) models belonging to the General Unified Threshold model for
Survival (GUTS) <span class="citation">[@jager2011;
@Jager2018GUTSbook]</span>. One is known as the <em>reduced stochastic
death</em> model <span class="citation">[@nyman2012]</span> or GUTS-SD
and the other is the <em>reduced organism tolerance</em> model or
GUTS-IT, which we describe now.</p>

<h4>GUTS Modelling</h4>
<p>The number of survivors at time <span class="math inline">\(t_k\)</span> given the number of survivors at time
<span class="math inline">\(t_{k-1}\)</span> is assumed to follow a
binomial distribution: <span class="math display">\[
N_i^k \sim \mathcal{B}(n_i^{k-1}, f_i(t_{k-1}, t_k))
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span> is the
conditional probability of survival at time <span class="math inline">\(t_k\)</span> given survival at time <span class="math inline">\(t_{k-1}\)</span> under concentration <span class="math inline">\(c_i(t)\)</span>. Denoting <span class="math inline">\(S_i(t)\)</span> the probability of survival at
time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, we have: <span class="math display">\[
f_i(t_{k-1}, t_k) = \frac{S_i(t_k)}{S_i(t_{k-1})}
\]</span></p>
<p>The formulation of the survival probability <span class="math inline">\(S_i(t)\)</span> in GUTS <span class="citation">[@jager2011]</span> is given by integrating the
<em>instantaneous mortality rate</em> <span class="math inline">\(h_i\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
S_i(t) = \exp \left( \int_0^t - h_i(u)\mbox{d}u \right)
\tag{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>In the model, function <span class="math inline">\(h_i\)</span> is
expressed using the internal concentration of contaminant (that is, the
concentration inside an organism) <span class="math inline">\(C^{\mbox{\)</span>{INT}<span class="math inline">\(}}_i(t)\)</span>. More precisely: <span class="math display">\[
h_i(t) = b_w \max(C^{\mbox{${\tiny INT}$}}_i(t) - z_w, 0) + h_b
\]</span> where (see Table of parameters):</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(b_w\)</span> is the and expressed in
concentration<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>.time<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> ;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(z_w\)</span> is the so-called and
represents a concentration threshold under which the contaminant has no
effect on organisms ;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(h_b\)</span> is the (mortality in
absence of contaminant), expressed in time<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>. \end{itemize}</li>
</ul>
<p>The internal concentration is assumed to be driven by the external
concentration, following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\mathop{\mathrm{d}\!}C^{\mbox{${\tiny
INT}$}}_i}{\mathop{\mathrm{d}\!}t}(t) = k_d (c_i(t) - C^{\mbox{${\tiny
INT}$}}_i(t))
\tag{1}
\]</span></p>
<p>We call parameter <span class="math inline">\(k_d\)</span> of Eq.(1)
the <em>dominant rate constant</em> (expressed in time<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>). It represents the speed at which
the internal concentration in contaminant converges to the external
concentration. The model could be equivalently written using an internal
damage instead of an internal concentration as a dose metric <span class="citation">[@jager2011]</span>.</p>
<p>If we denote <span class="math inline">\(f_z(z_w)\)</span> the
probability distribution of the no effect concentration threshold, <span class="math inline">\(z_w\)</span>, then the survival function is given
by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S(t) = \int_0^t S_i(t) f_z(z_w) \mbox{d} z_w= \int \exp \left( \int_0^t
- h_i(u)\mbox{d} u \right) f_z(z_w) \mbox{d} z_w
\]</span></p>
<p>Then, the calculation of <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span>
depends on the model of survival, GUTS-SD or GUTS-IT <span class="citation">[@jager2011]</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="guts-sd" class="section level4">
<h4>GUTS-SD</h4>
<p>In GUTS-SD, all organisms are assumed to have the same internal
concentration threshold (denoted <span class="math inline">\(z_w\)</span>), and, once exceeded, the
instantaneous probability to die increases linearly with the internal
concentration. In this situation, <span class="math inline">\(f_z(z_w)\)</span> is a Dirac delta distribution,
and the survival rate is given by Eq.(2).</p>
</div>
<div id="guts-it" class="section level4">
<h4>GUTS-IT</h4>
<p>In GUTS-IT, the threshold concentration is distributed among all the
organisms, and once exceeded for one organism, this organism dies
immediately. In other words, the killing rate is infinitely high (e.g.
<span class="math inline">\(k_k = + \infty\)</span>), and the survival
rate is given by: <span class="math display">\[
S_i(t) = e^{-h_b t} \int_{\max\limits_{0&lt;\tau &lt;t}(C^{\mbox{${\tiny
INT}$}}_i(\tau))}^{+\infty} f_z(z_w) \mbox{d} z_w= e^{-h_b t}(1-
F_z(\max\limits_{0&lt;\tau&lt;t} C^{\mbox{${\tiny INT}$}}_i(\tau)))
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(F_z\)</span> denotes the
cumulative distribution function of <span class="math inline">\(f_z\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here, the exposure concentration <span class="math inline">\(c_i(t)\)</span> is not supposed constant. In the
case of time variable exposure concentration, we use an midpoint ODE
integrator (also known as modified Euler, or Runge-Kutta 2) to solve
models GUTS-SD and GUTS-IT. When the exposure concentration is constant,
then, explicit formulation of integrated equations are used. We present
them in the next subsection.</p>
</div>
<div id="for-constant-concentration-exposure" class="section level3">
<h3>For constant concentration exposure</h3>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(c_i(t)\)</span> is constant, and
assuming <span class="math inline">\(C^{\mbox{\)</span>{INT}<span class="math inline">\(}}_i(0) = 0\)</span>, then we can integrate the
previous equation (1) to obtain:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
C^{\mbox{${\tiny INT}$}}_i(t) = c_i(1 - e^{-k_d t})
\tag{4}
\]</span></p>
<div id="guts-sd-1" class="section level4">
<h4>GUTS-SD</h4>
<p>In the case <span class="math inline">\(c_i &lt; z_w\)</span>, the
organisms are never affected by the contaminant:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S_i(t) = \exp( - h_b t )
\tag{3}
\]</span></p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(c_i &gt; z_w\)</span>, it takes time
<span class="math inline">\(t^z_i\)</span> before the internal
concentration reaches <span class="math inline">\(z_w\)</span>, where:
<span class="math display">\[
t^z_i = - \frac{1}{k_d} \log \left(1 - \frac{z_w}{c_i} \right).
\]</span> Before that happens, Eq.(3) applies, while for <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; t^z_i\)</span>, integrating Eq.(2) results
in: <span class="math display">\[
S_i(t) = \exp \left(- h_b t - b_w(c_i - z_w) (t - t^z_i) - \frac{b_w
c_i}{k_d} \left(e^{- k_d t} - e^{-k_d t^z_i} \right) \right)
\]</span></p>
<p>In brief, given values for the four parameters <span class="math inline">\(h_b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b_w\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(k_d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_w\)</span>, we can simulate trajectories by
using <span class="math inline">\(S_i(t)\)</span> to compute conditional
survival probabilities. In ‘morse’, those parameters are estimated using
Bayesian inference. The choice of priors is defined hereafter.</p>
</div>
<div id="guts-it-1" class="section level4">
<h4>GUTS-IT</h4>
<p>With constant concentration, Eq.(4) provides that <span class="math inline">\(C^{\mbox{\)</span>{INT}<span class="math inline">\(}}_i(t)\)</span> is an increasing function,
meaning that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\max\limits_{0 &lt; \tau &lt; t} (C^{\mbox{${\tiny INT}$}}_i(\tau)) =
c_i(1 - e^{-k_d t})
\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, assuming a log-logistic distribution for <span class="math inline">\(f_z\)</span> yields:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S_i(t) = \exp(- h_b t) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1+ \left(
\frac{c_i(1-\exp(-k_d t ))}{m_w} \right)^{- \beta}} \right)
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(m_w&gt;0\)</span> is the scale

those parameters based on the actual experimental design used in a

\]</span> With this choice, <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{\min}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{\max}\)</span> correspond to the 2.5 and
97.5 percentiles of the prior distribution on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. For each parameter, this
gives:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(z_w^{\min} = \min_{i, c_i \neq 0}
c_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_w^{\max} = \max_i
c_i\)</span>, which amounts to say that <span class="math inline">\(z_w\)</span> is most probably contained in the
range of experimentally tested concentrations ;</li>
<li>similarly, <span class="math inline">\(m_w^{\min} = \min_{i, c_i
\neq 0} c_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_w^{\max} = \max_i
c_i\)</span> ;</li>
<li>for background mortality rate <span class="math inline">\(h_b\)</span>, we assume a maximum value
corresponding to situations where half the indivuals are lost at the
first observation time in the control (time <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>), that is: <span class="math display">\[
e^{- h_b^{\max} t_1} = 0.5 \Leftrightarrow h_b^{\max} = - \frac{1}{t_1}
\log 0.5
\]</span> To derive a minimum value for <span class="math inline">\(h_b\)</span>, we set the maximal survival
probability at the end of the toxicity test in control condition to
0.999, which corresponds to saying that the average lifetime of the
considered species is at most a thousand times longer than the duration
of the experiment. This gives: <span class="math display">\[
e^{- h_b^{\min} t_m} = 0.999 \Leftrightarrow h_b^{\min} = -
\frac{1}{t_m} \log 0.999
\]</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(k_d\)</span> is the parameter describing
the speed at which the internal concentration of contaminant
equilibrates with the external concentration. We suppose its value is
such that the internal concentration can at most reach 99.9% of the
external concentration before the first time point, implying the maximum
value for <span class="math inline">\(k_d\)</span> is: <span class="math display">\[
1 - e^{- k_d^{\max} t_1} = 0.999 \Leftrightarrow k_d^{\max} = -
\frac{1}{t_1} \log 0.001
\]</span> For the minimum value, we assume the internal concentration
should at least have risen to 0.1% of the external concentration at the
end of the experiment, which gives: <span class="math display">\[
1 - e^{- k_d^{\min} t_m} = 0.001 \Leftrightarrow k_d^{\min} = -
\frac{1}{t_m} \log 0.999
\]</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(b_w\)</span> is the parameter relating
the internal concentration of contaminant to the instantaneous
mortality. To fix a maximum value, we state that between the closest two
tested concentrations, the survival probability at the first time point
should not be divided by more than one thousand, assuming (infinitely)
fast equilibration of internal and external concentrations. This last
assumption means we take the limit <span class="math inline">\(k_d
\rightarrow + \infty\)</span> and approximate <span class="math inline">\(S_i(t)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\exp(- (h_b + b_w(c_i - z_w))t)\)</span>. Denoting
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{\min}\)</span> the minimum
difference between two tested concentrations, we obtain: <span class="math display">\[
e^{- b_w^{\max} \Delta^{\min} t_1} = 0.001 \Leftrightarrow b_w^{\max} =
- \frac{1}{\Delta^{\min} t_1} \log 0.001
\]</span> Analogously we set a minimum value for <span class="math inline">\(b_w\)</span> saying that the survival probability
at the last time point for the maximum concentration should not be
higher than 99.9% of what it is for the minimal tested concentration.
For this we assume again <span class="math inline">\(k_d \rightarrow +
\infty\)</span>. Denoting <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{\max}\)</span> the maximum difference
between two tested concentrations, this leads to: <span class="math display">\[
e^{- b_w^{\min} \Delta^{\max} t_m} = 0.001 \Leftrightarrow b_w^{\min} =
- \frac{1}{\Delta^{\max} t_m} \log 0.999
\]</span></li>
<li>for the shape parameter <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>,
we used a quasi non-informative log-uniform distribution: <span class="math display">\[\log_{10} \beta \sim
\mathcal{U}(-2,2)\]</span></li>

<h1>Reproduction toxicity tests</h1>
<p>In a reproduction toxicity test, we observe the number of offspring
produced by a sample of adult organisms exposed to a certain
concentration of a contaminant over a given period of time. The
offspring (young organisms, clutches or eggs) are regularly counted and
removed from the medium at each time point, so that the reproducing
population cannot increase. It can decrease however, if some organisms
die during the experiment. The same procedure is usually repeated at
various concentrations of contaminant, in order to establish a
quantitative relationship between the reproduction rate and the
concentration of contaminant in the medium.</p>
<p>As already mentionned, it is often the case that part of the
organisms die during the observation period. In previous approaches, it
was proposed to consider the cumulated number of reproduction outputs
without accounting for mortality <span class="citation">[@OECD2004;
@OECD2008]</span>, or to exclude replicates where mortality occurred
<span class="citation">[@OECD2012]</span>. However, organisms may have
reproduced before dying and thus contributed to the observed response.
In addition, organisms dying the first are probably the most sensitive,
so the information on reproduction of these prematurely dead organisms
is valuable ; ignoring it is likely to bias the results in a
non-conservative way. This is particularly critical at high
concentrations, when mortality may be very high.</p>
<p>In a toxicity test, mortality is usually regularly recorded,
<em>i.e</em>. at each time point when reproduction outputs are counted.
Using these data, we can approximately estimate for each organism the
period it has stayed alive (which we assume coincides with the period it
may reproduce). As commonly done in epidemiology for incidence rate
calculations, we can then calculate, for one replicate, the total sum of
the periods of observation of each organism before its death (see next
paragraph). This sum can be expressed as a number of organism-days.
Hence, reproduction can be evaluated through the number of outputs per
organism-day.</p>
<p>In the following, we denote <span class="math inline">\(M_{ijk}\)</span> the observed number of surviving
organisms at concentration <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span>,
replicate <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and time <span class="math inline">\(t_k\)</span>.</p>
<div id="estimation-of-the-effective-observation-period" class="section level2">
<h2>Estimation of the effective observation period</h2>
<p>We define the effective observation period as the sum for all
organisms of the time they spent alive in the experiment. It is counted
in organism-days and will be denoted <span class="math inline">\(NID_{ij}\)</span> at concentration <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> and replicate <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. As mentionned earlier, mortality is
observed at particular time points only, so the real life time of an
organism is unknown and in practice we use the following simple
estimation: if an organism is alive at <span class="math inline">\(t_k\)</span> but dead at <span class="math inline">\(t_{k+1}\)</span>, its real life time is
approximated as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{t_{k+1}+t_k}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>With this assumption, the effective observation period at
concentration <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> and replicate
<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is then given by: <span class="math display">\[
NID_{ij} =   \sum_k M_{ij(k+1)} (t_{k+1} - t_k)
           + (M_{ijk} - M_{ij(k+1)})\left( \frac{t_{k+1}+t_k}{2} - t_k
\right)
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="target-time-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Target time analysis</h2>
<p>In this paragraph, we describe our so-called <em>target time
analysis</em>, where we model the cumulated number of offspring up to a
target time as a function of contaminant concentration and effective
observation time in this period (cumulated life times of all organisms
in the experiment, as described above). A more detailed presentation can
be found in <span class="citation">[@delignette2014]</span>.</p>
<p>We keep the convention that index <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is used for concentration levels and
<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> for replicates. The data will
therefore correspond to a set <span class="math inline">\(\{(NID_{ij},
N_{ij})\}_i\)</span> of pairs, where <span class="math inline">\(NID_{ij}\)</span> denotes the effective
observation period and <span class="math inline">\(N_{ij}\)</span> the
number of reproduction output. These observations are supposed to be
drawn independently from a distribution that is a function of the level
of contaminant <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span>.</p>
<div id="modelling-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Modelling</h3>
<p>We assume here that the effect of the considered contaminant on the
reproduction rate <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> does not depend on the exposure period, but
only on the concentration of the contaminant. More precisely, the
reproduction rate in an experiment at concentration <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> of contaminant is modelled by a
three-parameters log-logistic model, that writes as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(c;\theta)=\frac{d}{1+(\frac{c}{e})^b} \quad \textrm{with} \quad
\theta=(e,b,d)
\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> corresponds to the
reproduction rate in absence of contaminant (control condition) and
<span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> to the value of the <span class="math inline">\(EC_{50}\)</span>, that is the concentration
dividing the average number of offspring by two with respect to the
control condition. Then the number of reproduction outputs <span class="math inline">\(N_{ij}\)</span> at concentration <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> in replicate <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> can be modelled using a Poisson
distribution: <span class="math display">\[
N_{ij} \sim Poisson(f(c_i ; \theta) \times NID_{ij})
\]</span> This model is later referred to as <em>Poisson model</em>. If
there happens to be a non-negligible variability of the reproduction
rate between replicates at some fixed concentrations, we propose a
second model, named <em>gamma-Poisson model</em>, stating that: <span class="math display">\[
N_{ij} \sim Poisson(F_{ij} \times NID_{ij})
\]</span> where the reproduction rate <span class="math inline">\(F_{ij}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> in replicate <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is a random variable following a gamma
distribution. Introducing a dispersion parameter <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, we assume that: <span class="math display">\[
F_{ij} \sim gamma\left( \frac{f(c_i;\theta)}{\omega}, \frac{1}{\omega}
\right)
\]</span> Note that a gamma distribution of parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> has mean <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\alpha}{\beta^2}\)</span>, that is here
<span class="math inline">\(f(c_i;\theta)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega f(c_i;\theta)\)</span> respectively. Hence
<span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> can be considered as an
overdispersion parameter (the greater its value, the greater the
inter-replicate variability)</p>

<div id="inference-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Inference</h3>
<p>Posterior distributions for parameters <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> are estimated using JAGS
<span class="citation">[@rjags2016]</span> with the following
priors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>we assume the range of tested concentrations in an experiment is
chosen to contain the <span class="math inline">\(EC_{50}\)</span> with
high probability. More formally, we choose: <span class="math display">\[\log_{10} e \sim \mathcal{N}
\left(\frac{\log_{10} (\min_i c_i) + \log_{10} (\max_i c_i)}{2},
\frac{\log_{10} (\max_i c_i) - \log_{10} (\min_i c_i)}{4}
\right)\]</span> which implies <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>
has a probability slightly higher than 0.95 to lie between the minimum
and the maximum tested concentrations.</p></li>
<li><p>we choose a quasi non-informative prior distribution for the
shape parameter <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\log_{10} b \sim
\mathcal{U}(-2,2)\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>as <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> corresponds to the
reproduction rate without contaminant, we set a normal prior <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(\mu_d,\sigma_d)\)</span> using the
control: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
  \mu_d &amp; = \frac{1}{r_0} \sum_j \frac{N_{0j}}{NID_{0j}}\\
  \sigma_d &amp; = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_j \left( \frac{N_{0j}}{NID_{0j}} -
\mu_d\right)^2}{r_0(r_0 - 1)}}\\
\end{align*}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span> is the number
of replicates in the control condition. Note that since they are used to
estimate the prior distribution, the data from the control condition are
not used in the fitting phase.</p></li>
<li><p>we choose a quasi non-informative prior distribution for the
<span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> parameter of the
gamma-Poisson model: <span class="math display">\[log_{10}(\omega) \sim
\mathcal{U}(-4,4)\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>For a given dataset, the procedure implemented in ‘morse’ will fit
both models (Poisson and gamma-Poisson) and use an information criterion
known as Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) to choose the most
appropriate. In situations where overdispersion (that is inter-replicate
variability) is negligible, using the Poisson model will provide more
reliable estimates. That is why a Poisson model is preferred unless the
gamma-Poisson model has a sufficiently lower DIC (in practice we require
a difference of 10).</p>
